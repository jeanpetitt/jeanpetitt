- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeanpetitt
- 👀 I’m Software engineer and AI expert
- 🌱 I am currently working at TIB as a research student in the domain of scholarly communication. The main idea of my research is to use a Neuro-Symbolic AI approach to improve interactions between humans and computers.

Recently, I worked on semantic tabular data annotation, which resulted in a short paper entitled <strong>"Leveraging GPT Models for Semantic Table Annotation"</strong>. During this work, I also received the IBM Research Award for accuracy and LLM tracks during ISWC 2024 conference.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on github communauty
